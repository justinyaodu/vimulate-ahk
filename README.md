# Vimulate AHK

An [AutoHotKey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) script which emulates Vim keybindings in *any* application. Want to use hjkl in your word processor? Want a visual mode for editing spreadsheets? The possibilities are endless.

## Features

* **Fully modal**: switch between command, insert, and visual modes with the customary keyboard shortcuts
* **Extensive keybinding support**: supports as many keys as possible
* **Extensive application support**: achieved by translating Vim keybindings to widely used keyboard commands (for example, the hjkl keys become arrow keys)
* **Unobtrusive status window** which displays the current mode
* **Easy to toggle on and off** (so it doesn't get in the way when you're actually using Vim, for example)

### Quirks, Limitations, and Extra Features

* Multi-keystroke commands, counts, registers, and macros are not supported yet*
    * <kbd>g</kbd> commands are not supported yet, so <kbd>g</kbd> goes to the beginning of the file, like <kbd>g</kbd><kbd>g</kbd> in Vim*
* The <kbd>t</kbd><kbd>f</kbd><kbd>T</kbd><kbd>F</kbd> commands are not supported yet*
* All beginning-of-line commands (<kbd>|</kbd><kbd>^</kbd><kbd>0</kbd>) are "soft"
* Final cursor position after commands may not always match Vim behaviour
    * Paste behaviour especially; to support as many use-cases as possible, it simply uses <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd>
* Visual line mode doesn't work as expected when selecting lines upward*
* Commands that are typically followed by a movement (<kbd>d</kbd><kbd>c</kbd><kbd>y</kbd>) only operate on selections*
* Joining multiple selected lines with <kbd>J</kbd> is not supported
* <kbd>Shift</kbd> is sometimes not registered properly if held down while multiple keystrokes are issued
    * Page up/down (<kbd>H</kbd><kbd>L</kbd>) and indent adjustment (<kbd>\<</kbd><kbd>></kbd>) commands don't work if pressed multiple times while Shift is held down
* Instead of being used for marking, <kbd>m</kbd> becomes a [menu key](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_key)
* Although supported, mappings for <kbd>Backspace</kbd>, <kbd>Space</kbd>, and <kbd>Enter</kbd> are disabled by default for improved functionality in web browsers and other applications

_*Will be fixed in future versions._
